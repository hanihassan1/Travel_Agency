Interactive Front-end Development – Travel Agency
Ontario Wanderer is a website that focuses on travel within the province of Ontario. Users are able to find hotels, car rentals and restaurants in the city of the choice. Also, a little added bonus for users – they can actually search for hotels, car rentals and restaurants any where in the world.

Planning/Logic and resources:
I planned to make this site as easy for users to use as possible. With several eye-catching images and straight to the point search engines. 
I used HTML, JavaScript-API, Bootstrap, Google Fonts, Fonts Awesome, jQuery and CSS.  A lot of JS was used specifically for the API calling. The API I used is GOOGLES API.
The breakdown for the API is as follows; the hotel search button, followed by the Car and Restaurant search buttons. I made it so that it is easy for the user to search for what they are looking for and receive the information promptly.
There is no sound effects.
